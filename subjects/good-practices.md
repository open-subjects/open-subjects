# Good Practices

This page is a bunch of resources regarding good practices, either
directly technical or more collaboration-oriented.

## Commits

While using a VCS, try to aim for explicit, clear and meaningful commits.

Refrain from doing session-based commits (i.e.: every N hours) and make
your commits match with what you are currently doing, like a feature,
a bugfix or even editing the CI.

## Issues

Most git-supporting websites (Github, Gitlab) implement the concept of Issues.

Use them to track your work, your roadmap or bugfixes.

Aim to explicit as much as possible what the Issue is.

## Documentation

### How to write documentation

The most common syntax used to write documentation as text is the **Markdown**.

### Host documentation

You can easily host your static websites using 3rd party services like Github Pages
to make it viewable.
